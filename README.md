### Hey, I'm Merlin! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a 21-year-old Computer Science student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), deeply passionate about creating innovative solutions that bridge technology and environmental sustainability. While my academic journey has me immersed in the world of code, my curiosity extends far beyond. From artificial intelligence and user experience design to the psychology behind technology, I find excitement in the interplay between technology and human experience.

My enthusiasm doesn't stop at software. I am committed to exploring and implementing sustainable mobility and renewable energy technologies. Whether it's building an e-bike from 3D-printed parts, crafting a vertical wind turbine, or setting up a solar-powered system, I'm always on the hunt for ways to leverage technology for a greener future. And yes, capturing the beauty of our planet with my drone is a hobby that never ceases to amaze me.

This GitHub is a showcase of my journey, featuring a mix of experimental and polished projects that reflect my dedication to tech innovation and environmental conservation. While not exhaustive or perfect, it represents a snapshot of my ongoing exploration into how technology can be a force for good.

Feel free to reach out to me via email for collaborations, discussions, or just to share your thoughts on the future of technology and sustainability. If you're a ChatGPT-Plus subscriber, why not have a chat with a virtual clone of me for fun? Let's explore the limitless possibilities together!
